                <strong>Hi There!</strong>ðŸ‘‹ If you are here then that means you saw
                my first <strong><em>(attempted)</em></strong> portfolio project and
                (<u>HOPEFULLY</u>) enjoyed what I had displayed there. That got you
                thinking to yourself, "ðŸ¤”, I liked what I saw, Who is this guy and
                Where can I find him"

                Well, wonder no longer Welcome! Welcome! one and all. My name is
                Shaik Kamil as you could've guessed from my main page. I like to
                think of myself as an up & coming Web developer/ Software engineer/
                Fullstack Savant <strong><em>(TBD)</em></strong>ðŸ˜‰. On a lightly serious note, I am a proud father of
                two who is
                currently on path to transition to tech from a non-tech background .
                That's the short version. Feel free to reach out to me on linkedIn
                to discuss more about my next steps, role and collaborations. To see
                more (soon to be)projects, you can visit my Github.
